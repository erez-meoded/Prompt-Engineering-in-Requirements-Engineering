#####  Comodo Firewall
Keeping your computer secured while connected to the Internet is a must for anyone. Operating systems come equipped with basic tools for such tasks, but there are various applications out there strictly dedicated and with enhanced features. Comodo Firewall is one of them and promises to stand by your side while browsing the web.

From the first step of the installation process you need to pay attention so you only get desired items installed, as the application comes bundled with other offers as well. Moreover, your actions determine the overall behavior, as you can set the application to adapt to your activities so it automatically blocks or allows specific connections.

The interface is quite modern and intuitive, letting anyone quickly accommodate, with full support from a rich online help manual. The application also brings a small widget on your desktop to display current security status and provide quick access to its features.

By default, virtually every interaction is monitored, with popups requiring your close attention whether or not to allow the specific task to be performed. You can also choose to remember options, for example in case of certain software updates.

It manages to do a pretty good job overall, with a lot of info accessible, regarding quarantined files or processes that are dependent of your Internet connection. In terms of accessibility, the application gives you free hand to handle nearly anything it is capable of. The settings menu is rich, covering general, security, as well as firewall options, each with dedicated features. For example, you can thoroughly manage protected objects that can be simple files, registry keys or even COM interfaces.

The application also gives you access to a gaming mode that is cleverly optimized to allow only game related connections to be established for a smooth gaming experience. What's more, untrusted items can be sandboxed, in other words have them launched in a protected environment that does not make system changes until you allow them to.

Little of your system's resources are used by the application. Even though the utility is incredibly powerful, we managed to encounter a serious system crash when restarting for new settings to be applied on Windows 8.1. This is not a general rule though, as the situations differ from machine to machine.

All things considered, Comodo Firewall does indeed live up to expectations and delivers the promised result. It takes little accommodation, with most attention required being in the installation process. The feature pack is abundant and intuitive, stored in a well-designed interface. This might just be the right tool if you're looking from extra protection.

#####  Privatefirewall
The Internet has become the most popular and comfortable way to communicate and gather information. Nevertheless, a certain level of protection is needed, since there is plenty of malware on the Web waiting for a victim.

Privatefirewall is an application that allows you to add extra security measures for your system. Its main advantage is that it allows you to prevent intrusions on the computer and protect it from information theft.

This application integrates several different protection methods, which include a desktop firewall, an application manager, a process monitor, port tracking and traffic filtering. You can set different protection profiles for home, office and remote access.

Using Privatefirewall, you are able to easily customize the Internet and network security features to a level that suits your needs and preferences. This can be done easily, as the program offers you a user-friendly interface. Nevertheless, it is advisable that beginners use the default configuration of the application because rules granting/denying access to various programs could work against you unless you know what you’re doing. For example, activating some rules can lead to blocking network file sharing.

The application allows you to create a 'Trusted sites / IP addresses' list, as well as a black list for untrusted websites and IP addresses. Thus, Privatefirewall automatically blocks the access to the web pages that are found on the black list. Also, you can enable the email anomaly detection, in order to filter the received messages.

A list of all the applications that attempted to access the Internet is also displayed. For every one of them, you can configure the rules to allow or deny online access. Processes can be filtered for potentially malicious system API calls, thus blocking the dangerous ones. It also tracks all system ports, protecting them against unauthorized entries.

For every detected activity, the program displays an alert and you can allow or block the corresponding process. However, you are offered the possibility to change the notification method.

Taking everything into consideration, we can say that Privatefirewall monitors system behavior to identify potential threats and protect your private data, allowing you to easily customize Internet security settings and untrusted websites. This makes it a handy application overall.

#####  Sygate Personal Firewall Free
A computer with an active Internet connection is exposed to a large variety of threats, be them malicious software or virtual attacks. If you consider that tools provided by your operating system are not strong enough, you can always look for alternatives. One of them is Sygate Personal Firewall Free and promises to keep private settings safe in a simple manner.

Sygate Personal Firewall Free is one of the old applications that used to set the bar when it came to computer security. The level of protection offered by this firewall is among the best and it is now the foundation of the 'Smart Firewall' you will find in Symantec's Norton Internet Security.

However, the application is only capable of running on versions of Windows until XP, making it obsolete for most modern computers. Still, if you're using an older machine that needs a simple tool to defend the computer, Sygate Personal Firewall can actually be the top choice.

Please note that since the developer is no longer making it available as a standalone product, Sygate Personal Firewall receives the default three-star rating, which doesn't reflect our opinion on the product.

Sygate Personal Firewall Free can still be of help for computers running older Windows versions. It does not take a lot of getting used to and is light on system resources. It is the backbone of modern firewall services nowadays, thus deserving a seat at the winners table.

#####  Sunbelt Personal Firewall
Sunbelt Personal Firewall helps control how computers share information with other computers through the Internet or a local network. It also protects computers from external or internal attacks from other computers. The Personal Firewall is especially useful for laptop computers since they are easier to compromise because of built-in wireless access.

Basically, a firewall is a program that protects one computer from other computers. It examines information that tries to enter a computer from an outside source (i.e. the internet), and determines if the information is safe or harmful.

Known Issues/Limitations

Norton 2008/Norton LiveUpdate users may see CPU spikes when SPF is installed on the same machine.

#####  Jetico Personal Firewall
Malware can spread to your computer in many ways, not only by opening an infected file or plugging in an infected USB drive to your PC. There are also some experienced hackers who can connect to your PC or viruses who can take advantage of the vulnerabilities in your Internet connection to ‘call home’ and send your personal information, as collected via browsers. Powerful firewall protection can prevent all these from happening, and Jetico Personal Firewall can provide such protection.

After you install the app, you will be guided towards configuring its settings (if you are unsure about some of them, you can just leave them to their default values), then it is recommended to reboot the computer to make sure all changes are applied correctly.

The main window of software utility enables you to monitor your network traffic so you can start analyzing your Internet connections as soon as you notice a surge in activity.

Whenever a third-party application attempts to connect to the Internet or to the network, a notification window will be displayed and you can specify whether you want to allow the app to connect or not.

You can explore all the currently running programs, analyze their properties and terminate all that you do not recognize. You can even copy the text string and paste within another file, if you want to thoroughly examine the info at a later time.

Due to Jetico Personal Firewall, you can define groups of IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your PC by default, as well as a group of IPs that are blocked from doing so. You can specify them one by one or you can enter an IP range.

Jetico Personal Firewall can help you protect your computer from a wide range of Internet and network threats, but you will need to purchase a license if you want to enjoy for a longer period of time. You should also install an antivirus solution, to complement the firewall’s protection.

#####  PC Tools Firewall Plus
It's best to have a security application installed when having to work with an active Internet connection. One such tool is PC Tools Firewall Plus, a comprehensive software solution for identifying and eliminating malware, while giving you the possibility of managing network access for open applications.

The GUI consists of a single window organized into six main areas, namely “Status”, “Applications”, “Profiles”, “History”, “Activity” and “Settings”.

The first panel gives you an overview on the product version, updates, sent and received data. Plus, you can quickly toggle firewall protection mode.

When it comes to active applications, users may allow or block network access for a specific process with the simple click of a button. Advanced settings are available, as it is possible to enable app logging, customize the Enhanced Security Permissions (ESPs) (e.g. allow kernel access, modify and control system), as well as configure a list of rules for sent and received packets through query statements.

PC Tools Firewall Plus also lets you create and organize advanced firewall rules for individual profiles; you can set up connections with overriding ports, along with a trusted IP list.

Plenty of settings may be configured for this utility. For instance, you can adjust firewall security mode, show traffic information in a tray icon, modify network settings, as well as enable password protection and full screen detection.

To sum it up, PC Tools Firewall Plus offers multilingual support, has a good response time and runs on a surprisingly low amount of CPU and RAM. No errors have been displayed throughout our tests, and the utility did not hang or crash. Thanks to its intuitive GUI and advanced settings, PC Tools Firewall Plus should please power users.

#####  PeerGuardian
File sharing is a unique experience and while it has countless advantages, the downsides make quite the list too. One of the most negative aspects of file sharing and Internet surfing, in general, is that your privacy is never fully protected.

When online, various organizations attempt to connect to your IP and steal personal information without you being aware of it. PeerGuardian was designed to prevent unauthorized connections by blocking harmful IPs from getting in touch with your computer.

PeerGuardian is basically a firewall utility and is especially effective in protecting you when you use peer to peer connections. It has access to an online blocklist database which is continuously updated, thus ensuring day-to-day protection.

The installation process of PeerGuardian needs user assistance, since it requires you to configure a few settings. The first step is to select the types of organizations/items to be blocked (P2P / Ads / Spyware / Government / Educational). Next, the application prompts you to add the list of IPs to be processed; the source can be a text file or a URL. The final step allows you to configure the update feature for the online database.

PeerGuardian’s interface is simple and easy to work with. It allows you to view the allowed/blocked IPs and provides quick access to the IP list manager. Settings include log and history preferences, as well as notification options.

During our tests, PeerGuardian performed flawlessly. It managed to detect and close all the connections from specified IP ranges and protected us from harmful P2P IP addresses.

Even though the development of PeerGuardian has halted, the application works properly. It is actively maintained only on Linux and developers encourage Windows users to migrate to PeerBlock, a fork of PeerGuardian.

#####  Kerio Control
Business environments need much more stronger protective structures than the average user simply because they are more prone to be targeted by malware threats or hacker attacks. For this reason, the advanced security in their case consists of software solutions doubled by dedicated hardware devices.

Among the many types of such appliances that are available on the market, you can now find Kerio Control, a specialized Unified Threat Management (UTM) firewall that covers a broad spectrum of network protection needs.

Manageable from any Internet browser, the software component takes care of applications, incoming and outgoing traffic, filters content and monitors user activities in order to prevent and fight off any potential menace that may affect the environment it is supposed to secure.

Kerio Control is able to work with several network and Internet interfaces, including VPN servers and it offers easy to use bandwidth and traffic management functions. By enforcing HTTP as well as FTP policies, users and URL addresses can be kept under control through rules that are easy to create and edit.

When it comes to virus detection and elimination, Kerio Control is able to put to work a solution that may already be integrated in the target environment, or it can employ an external engine. The supported protocols for this kind of security include SMTP, POP3, FTP and HTTP. Besides the internal settings of each antivirus solution, this software comes with its own policies that act like a supplemental insurance that the protection will not fail.

Kerio Control is clearly meant for business usage and not for the larger audience. The high degree of detailing offered as well as the powerful control functions make this tool one that network administrators would use with maximum efficiency.

The program tries to tackle the needs of both beginners and more experienced users with a user-friendly and straightforward interface, but also with a detailed help menu that comprises tons of information concerning its features.

Lavasoft Personal Firewall may be incompatible with some other security applications, such as antivirus products, so the installer first scans the computer for such programs and tells you about potential problems from the get go.

Once installation comes to an end, the user is prompted to choose whether he wants to use the program in 'Normal' or in 'Advanced' mode, providing different levels of security and rules addressed to novice and more experienced users, respectively.

The main window of the app is nothing special, but it gives instant access to its main features, be they firewall, host protection, web control or event viewer.

Setting the application up might be a bit difficult for beginners, as the dedicated options menu comprises tons of entries, each of the aforementioned features coming with its very own set of configurable options.

While Lavasoft Personal Firewall boasts all the features usually implemented in a powerful firewall, what we liked the most was the so-called auto-learning mode which keeps an eye on the way to you control the apps and thus reduces the number of alerts it launches.

It features a dedicated 'Entertainment Mode' that will automatically detect when you are watching movies or playing games so that it doesn't show any alerts.

Other than that, it features a web control tool to make sure no malicious software attempts to disable the firewall, host protection to defend the computer against dangerous files, network activity monitor to block certain connections and custom firewall rules to help you set your very own rules.

Lavasoft Personal Firewall is a pretty good security solution that comes with a decent set of features. You don't need a supercomputer to run the application, and it even comes with 64-bit support. So if already installed security applications leave a little something to be desired, don't hesitate to give this one a try.

#####  Firewall Context Menu
As its name suggests, Firewall Context Menu is a lightweight and useful, little application that provides users with a quick way to either allow or block various executable files’ network access with no more than a few mouse clicks.

What makes this app noteworthy is the way it smoothly integrates with the Windows contextual menu. All users have to do is right-click any executable file, and choose one of the three available options such as “Allow in Windows Firewall,” “Block in Windows Firewall,” and “Delete from Windows Firewall.”

With that in mind, it’s quite clear that Firewall Context Menu has a lot of good and practical uses. For example, the app might prove to be helpful for users who are looking to prevent potentially suspicious software from communicating to an unsecured server or source, or from blocking known apps from updating, just to name a few.

The installation procedure is quite straightforward, as users only need to make sure that .NET Framework 4.0 or newer is installed on their computers. While the “Delete from Windows Firewall” option is the most straightforward one (as it deletes the existing firewall rule for the selected executable file), the first two have a bit more depth.

When choosing “Allow in Windows Firewall” or “Block in Windows Firewall,” users are instantly provided with a tiny dialog box that allows them to choose from five (or all five) options. Users can allow or block executable to private or public networks, as well as domains. Users can also allow or block the direction, either incoming or outgoing.

To conclude, Firewall Context Menu is not what one might call a generally appealing app since most users don’t really require this level of network access control. However, for the few that need a quick way to turn network access for various apps on or off quickly, this app is extremely useful and, most importantly, very easy to use.

##### Firewall Easy 
Sometimes, malware-filled software can disguise themselves in seemingly harmless applications that can destroy or siphon your private files with the purpose of blackmailing you. Other times, your favorite single-player game can request access to the internet for sending personal data to advertisers.

Regardless of the situation, restricting some apps’ capabilities of accessing the internet can be lifesaving. One particularly useful way of doing so is via Firewall Easy, thanks to its integration with the Windows context menu.

Running the application will summon a simple layout displaying a list of the programs that have been blocked from accessing the internet. This program’s accessible interface gives users an alternative to Windows’ aging “Defender Firewall with Advanced Security”, whose design can seem cluttered to those who simply want to restrict internet access to various software.

Adding programs to the list of blocked apps can be done using a built-in file picker for those who want to carry out the task without leaving the main window. The items in the list act as rules, with the option to also remove them individually, in case users change their mind regarding the workflow of a certain executable.

One of the most important functions is its integration with Windows, with the program automatically implementing a command to the context menu to add selected files to the list. This makes for a painless experience for those concerned that a suspicious piece of software may gather and send their personal data outside the local area network.

Blocking rules can be exported in a proprietary format for backup purposes, which can be useful for situations in which the user needs to reinstall the operating system. When uninstalling applications whose internet access was blocked, their rules can sometimes linger in the program’s list. As such, a special option can be triggered to refresh the list to avoid confusion.

For times when more advanced settings need to be changed, a dedicated shortcut to launching the Windows Firewall can be found in the lower left corner, providing users with flexibility that is tailored to their specific workflow.

Windows users who are tired of navigating through the archaic interface of the built-in networking feature set may find good use in Firewall Easy’s context menu integration and simple design focused on quickly blocking internet access to applications which may not need it in the first place.

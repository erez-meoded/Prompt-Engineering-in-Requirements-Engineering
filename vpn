#####  OpenVPN
OpenVPN provides a full-featured open source SSL VPN solution that accommodates a wide range of configurations, including remote access, site-to-site VPNs, Wi-Fi security, and enterprise-scale remote access solutions with load balancing, failover, and fine-grained access-controls.

Starting with the fundamental premise that intricacy is the enemy of security, OpenVPN offers a cost-efficacious, lightweight alternative to other VPN technologies that is well-targeted for the SME and enterprise markets. OpenVPN's lightweight design sheds many of the intricacies that characterize other VPN implementations. The OpenVPN security model is predicated on SSL, the industry standard for secure communications via the cyber world.

OpenVPN implements OSI layer 2 or 3 secure network extension utilizing the SSL/TLS protocol, fortifies flexible client authentication methods predicated on certificates, perspicacious cards, and/or 2-factor authentication, and sanctions user or group-concrete access control policies utilizing firewall rules applied to the VPN virtual interface. OpenVPN is not a web application proxy and does not operate through a web browser.

OpenVPN's principal strengths include cross-platform portability across most of the kenned computing universe, excellent stability, scalability to hundreds or thousands of clients, relatively facile installation, and support for dynamic IP addresses and NAT.

OpenVPN provides an extensible VPN framework which has been designed to facilitate site-concrete customization, such as providing the capability to distribute a customized installation package to clients, or fortifying alternative authentication methods via OpenVPN's plugin module interface.

OpenVPN offers a management interface which can be acclimated to remotely control or centrally manage an OpenVPN daemon. The management interface can withal be acclimated to develop a GUI or web-predicated front-end application for OpenVPN.

TLS is the latest evolution of the SSL family of protocols developed pristinely by Netscape for their first secure web browser. TLS and its SSL predecessors have optically discerned widespread utilization on the web for many years and have been extensively analyzed for impotencies.

In turn, this analysis has led to a subsequent invigorating of the protocol such that today, SSL/TLS is considered to be one of the most vigorous and most mature secure protocols available. As such, we believe TLS is an excellent cull for the authentication and key exchange mechanism of a VPN product.

The bottom line is that OpenVPN is built for portability, is facile to utilize, has been rigorously designed and tested to operate robustly on unreliable networks with a vigorously modular design. Moreover, OpenVPN is expeditious and while OpenVPN provides many options for controlling the security parameters of the VPN tunnel, it additionally provides options for forfending the security of the server itself.

#####  VPN Gate Client Plug-in
VPN Gate Client Plug-in serves as an innovative solution to address online accessibility, privacy, and security concerns. Through a global network of diverse servers contributed by volunteers, VPN Gate can empower you to navigate past restrictions, protecting your identity, and securing online communications.

One of the most notable features of the tool is its robust infrastructure, boasting an impressive network of over 7,000 public VPN servers strategically positioned across the globe. Primarily relying on volunteers, the server distribution covers key regions worldwide, with a strong presence in Asia.

While the dynamic nature of the VPN Gate network provides real-time information about available servers and supported VPN protocols, the problem is that they are run by volunteers. Consequently, the servers may go offline when owners shut down their computers, leading to occasional unavailability of specific locations.

A further shortcoming resulting from this is the unreliable speed, especially if you are not located in Asia. Unlike its paid counterparts, it lacks the quick-connect feature that enables you to automatically connect to the fastest VPN server.

The app stands out among free VPN providers by offering robust encryption through SoftEther, utilizing up to 256-bit AES encryption, RSA 4096-bit key encryption, and SHA-1 hashing. It supports multiple protocols, albeit varying by server due to the autonomous operation by volunteers.

Despite the commendable encryption and protocol options, it lacks some standard features found in other VPN services. Notable omissions include a kill switch, port forwarding for torrents, and explicit information on IPv6, DNS, or WebRTC leak protection. Considering the rudimentary security features, it is safe to assume that the app is more of a convenient solution for quick device security, especially in public settings.

Lastly, it is important to note that the volunteers have absolute control over whatâ€™s happening on their servers. They have the discretion to decide whether they will keep logs of user activities, including IP addresses, visited websites, and downloads.

They have the autonomy to determine how long they retain user information. The absence of a standardized policy across the network increases the risk of varying privacy practices and numerous risks when using VPN Gate Client Plug-in.

No matter the application you use (email client, web browser etc.), the connection appears as coming from another location and your identity is hidden, thus preventing unwanted tracking.

The server changes every time a connection is made and the application does not log connection details. Together with the integrated virtual firewall, these features provide you with an additional security layer, ensuring that the connection is truly safe.

The application features unlimited traffic and provides fast navigation speed. Changing the IP address results in removing the restrictions that some websites impose for different geographical regions. For instance, you can use it to watch national TV channels while you are abroad.

You can also apply a proxy configuration for establishing the Internet connection. Configuration settings can be exported to file and later imported to pick up where you left off.

In the main app window, you can check out the peer, VPN virtual IP address, public IP, protocol, traverse NAT status and private chat mode, as well as choose a Windows file to share. You can ping hosts from the right-click menu and connect to them remotely.

A VPN chat room is put at your disposal to exchange messages with other users connected to the same server (chat emoticons can be used too). You can also allow or deny access to certain peers, ask the tool to hide blocked peers, and view log details with the program's activity. Personal information can be edited when it comes to the username, password, full name, email and address. Moreover, you can ask the tool to act as a gateway.

The tool worked smoothly on Windows 10 in our tests without putting a strain on system resources consumption. It contains handy options for creating a VPN and configuring settings. However, it hasn't been updated for a considerable amount of time.

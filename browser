######### Chrome
Ever since the inception of the concept of the Internet, back in the 1960s, and all the way until present times, the growing emphasis has seen a shift from a “how can we access something on the Web”, to “how fast and effectively can we access something on the Web” mindset. It’s no wonder that such resolutions also yielded the requirement of having specialized software for doing so, up to today’s browsers. Being distinguishable in an ever-growing pool of such apps is becoming increasingly difficult, and one cannot help but wonder: does this latest iteration of Google Chrome has what it takes to compete, or even overtake its competitors?

Armed with an approach that encompasses a design that features simplicity, without having to sacrifice essential browsing features, it promises to provide users with efficient, unhindered navigation, with several extra features here and there, to ensure a smooth ride all the way.

As cliché as it might be, simplicity is key for most scenarios, and it’s quite obvious that this aspect has been accounted for in Chrome’s design. The last thing you’d want would be a cluttered interface, to distract you from the one thing that a browser should allow you to: surf the Web with no encumbrance whatsoever.

However, one might argue that too much minimalism can be detrimental, but as far as we’re concerned, we failed to see a single affected aspect or feature that might be truncated or lacking in functionality. It’s all there, at a single click away.

There are several core features that we find essential in any browser and are commonly found in most these days. We’re referring here of course to the use of tabs for controlling the surfing session and all their associated advantages.

However, when going past the essentials, one will be able to also find some extra touches, which although not significant, can make a difference. For instance, out of many, one such feature is the dedicated task manager, which can take resource management at a whole new level: tab-level, basically allowing you to better control the app, by previewing and, if required, terminating one or multiple tabs.

It would be unfair not to mention the presence of the Incognito mode, which although pretty standard these days, is essential to have around.

Last, but certainly not least, we feel that coming pre-packed with several extensions, such as those addressing online Office requirements – Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides, is a smart choice, as there are a number of instances we can think of, that might require their presence. Having them installed by default, can simplify things considerably.

Surfing the Web these days can sometimes be quite demanding, and why not, even cumbersome. But actually, it doesn’t have to be like that. Relying on a “Swiss-knife” tool for your online endeavors is more important than you’d think, and we feel that Google Chrome, with its versatile approach, does manage to provide such reliability, making the entire Web-surfing experience a simple and enjoyable one.


####### FireFox
For a very long time, two titans have been disputing the supremacy in the browsing world, and Firefox has its well-deserved share of fans who would always bring into discussion its outstanding performance and the constant care it has proved over time as regards user needs.

Having embarked on a never-ending quest to quench users’ thirst for seamless speed, Firefox has been the subject of continuous refinements, which have culminated with the release of the Quantum project, which has once again confirmed the browser’s maturity.

Firefox entails all the browsing tools any user out there might need and even more. It is capable of opening as many tabs as you want without making deductions from speed, and the low memory consumption is among the top promises it makes to its users. That means loading pages is done lightning fast, so you have instant access to all the websites you want to visit.

As regards safe browsing, it is definitely not a matter of if, what with the possibility of surfing the Internet via private windows as well as turning to the integrated tools aimed at disabling tracking in case you are worried about the issue. Apart from that, ensuring that your browsing history is unavailable to unauthorized users is an option, and granting the required permissions to websites you are visiting to use your location, camera, and microphone is entirely up to you.

Needless to say, keeping track of downloads, juggling with bookmarks, and taking screenshots without leaving your browser is possible, which once again proves Firefox’s focus on productivity and collaborative work. Moreover, syncing anything ranging from bookmarks to tabs, history, passwords, add-ons, and other settings across multiple devices should help you work without any sort of interruptions, regardless of where and when you decide to do so.

Customizing the search options that best cater to your needs should not take more than a couple of seconds, and that includes selecting the default search engine.

A wide assortment of customizations are available so that the browser’s behavior meet each an every expectation you might have, and an overflow menu is there for you to fill with all sorts of items (for instance History, Find, Add-ons, Email Link, etc.) you use on a daily basis but prefer not to be visible in the toolbar.

When it comes to developers, Firefox greets them with a series of tools specifically designed for them. To name a few, Toggle Tools, Web Console, Network, Inspector, Performance, Style Editor, Page Source, WebIDE, Developer Toolbar, and more should guarantee they can thoroughly inspect pages, execute code, and more.

What’s for sure is that Firefox is one of the top choices when it comes to browsers, and its commitment to offering a secure, responsive, and why not fashionable environment for users to use has been constantly shown. The product keeps on benefiting from constant updates that have managed to turn it into one of the most trust-worthy apps of its kind, and smooth browsing is one of the things it takes most pride in.

###### Opera
Opera is one of the most popular modern browsers all over the world (together with Firefox, Chrome and Edge), and its reputation has been established throughout numerous years of research into improving its stability, security and feature-set.

Just like all the other mentioned browsers, you can visit websites, add bookmarks and explore the download history, as well as install extensions, however there are some elements that help make Opera stand out.

This browser aims to make things as simple as possible not only for experts, but also for novices, and this is why it packs several tools that are meant to make their lives easier.

For example, Opera packs integration with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram, so you no longer need to run third-party apps or keep several tabs open for the web-based clients.

You also get a built-in weather forecast that displays the details about your chosen location (it can be disabled with ease if you are not pleased with it). You can also replace the default browser wallpaper with one of the available options or a custom  image of your choosing.

In terms of user security, Opera researchers try their best to keep the user safe without restricting any actions, so all the features are not intrusive in any way, you just set them once and they run in the background.

This is the behavior for the ad blocker and tracker blocker, as they do their job without constantly showing which data they blocked, yet tech-savvy users can still examine it if they need to.

As for the integrated VPN, it comes in handy when you want to access online content that you are banned from because of your geographical location. Unlike dedicated third-party solutions, you do not get a limited amount of data you can use, so you can enjoy its features without any limits.

Opera lives up to its reputation due to its committed team of researchers that strive to provide users with simplicity and appealing GUI, but without sacrificing anything on the security front.


###### Internet Explorer 10
When it comes to choosing the weapon of choice for browsing the Internet, the opinions are quite divided and there is a good reason for that, because the major players are each better than the other in some respect. Looks, speed, ease of use, extensibility are some of the major aspects to be considered before making a decision.

For those who would like to skip countless benchmarks, reviews, comparative tests and simply start browsing the web, Microsoft equipped Windows with its proprietary application, the well-known Internet Explorer.

If the previous versions struggled to keep up with web standards and many a time failed to deliver the best experience to their users, IE 10 is set to rectify that. From the get-go you will notice that the interface received little changes from the previous release.

Internet Explorer manages to perform better now, even with more tabs opened and this means that some code optimizations have been made under the hood for certain. Browsing speed is also ameliorated, like any benchmark will reveal.

An innovation that was surely awaited for by the entire IE fanbase is the ability to restore the tabs from the last session. However, saving and managing sessions, which can be done by most of the other competitors, is something that remains, for the time being, on the wishlist.

In terms of security, Internet Explorer 10 offers a noticeably improved protection against phishing, through the SmartScreen Filter. Another plus that is worth mentioning is the new feature that allows users to add sites to the 'Start Screen' through the 'Tools' menu.

With most of the modifications and improvements made to ensure a smoother and faster navigation, IE 10 gains a lot in performance compared to its predecessor. Nonetheless, Internet Explorer still can't really keep up with competitors such as Chrome or Firefox and even Opera, which surpass Microsoft's browser, especially because their development is much more accelerated.



###### ViVadi
In a world where web browsers try desperately to copy and match each other’s features and latest gimmicks, there’s one browser that stands out in more ways than thought possible. Built by a team of Opera expatriates, the browser in question is called Vivaldi, and ever since it left the technical preview development stage, it has been slowly making a name for itself.

Right off the bat, it’s worth noting that Vivaldi is not the prettiest, the safest, or the fastest browser out there. In short, Vivaldi might not be everyone’s cup of tea, as we all know how diverse user preferences can be and how even the most little of details can often tip the scales when it comes to choosing “the best browser.”

That said, even though Vivaldi is remarkably intuitive, and literally anyone can fully appreciate and take advantage of its kit, the browser is designed for a specific type of user, the type of user who appreciates customization/configurability above all else. And, we’re not just talking about visual aesthetics here, as Vivaldi grants users the ability to tweak and fine-tune virtually every little working part of the browser’s features and GUI to create a unique and perfectly tailored experience.

By default, Vivaldi looks just like most browsers, with the typical layout one might expect: tab bar on top, followed by a typical toolbar with all the basic controls and search bar underneath, the browsing section, and two more interesting toolbars - one on the left side of the GUI (with easy-to-reach sections such as History, Downloads, Bookmarks, and Notes) and one at the bottom.

This is where all the similarities end, though, as Vivaldi’s interface is extremely adaptive. The browser provides users with a plethora of themes (which can be scheduled to change at various times), the ability to add any site to the sidebar, change the position of any toolbar element, and much more such wizardry.

The GUI has a built-in zoom tool, for both itself and the pages users visit, a nifty reader view, customizable page actions, a full-screen mode, and a vertical reader mode. If up until now things don’t seem spectacular, wait until you start discovering everything Vivaldi has to offer in terms of tab management.

All these customization features are designed to do one thing: ensuring the best possible web browsing experience and, ultimately, increase productivity. Vivaldi unique features such as tab stacking, tab tiling, session management, auto-stacking tabs, tab cycling, tab hibernation, lazy loading, and multi-tab selection.

For example, tab stacking is extremely useful when it comes to decluttering the browser’s workspace, and particularly useful for users who usually work with large numbers of tabs. Tab tiling allows users to view several tabs at the same time, a very useful feature for researching purposes.

Vivaldi still has a lot more customization features. Users can change the window and the start window background images, add extensions (most Chrome Web Store extensions work on Vivaldi since it shares the same engine with Google Chrome), add speed dial thumbnails, and tweak image and animation loading options for each page.

For those who doubt Vivaldi’s functionality potential and may even call it gimmicky, it’s worth noting that data from Vivaldi can be synchronized across multiple computers, you capture instant screenshots using a neat built-in tool, take advantage of a useful Developer Tools section, and even tweak your Philips Hue lights.

Vivaldi also boasts support for keyboard shortcuts, mouse gestures, quick commands, rocker gestures, and other single-key shortcuts, all in the name of increased productivity. In terms of privacy options, the browser boasts private windows, private search, encrypted synchronization, WebRTC IP Privacy Settings, and a cookie manager.

By now, it should be quite clear that Vivaldi has a staggeringly high number of little features, every one of which can be fully or partially customized. One thing that will stand out is the browser’s Settings section, a section that is without a doubt – very complex, especially for first timers.

What this means is that Vivaldi will most definitely become the right hand of any power user who values customization and wants to boost his or her productivity while browsing. However, it can be just as easily be argued that this bulky feature set is the browser’s implicit weakness. While most of its features are buried deep in the Settings menu which can take a while to find, others are behind little icons scattered around the browser’s GUI which might also make things a bit confusing at first.

Vivaldi might feel awkward at first. However, put in a little time and effort to customize it based on your needs, and you’ll soon discover that Vivaldi can feel just right. At the end of the day, Vivaldi can be so much more than a more practical alternative to regular browsers.


##### Chromium
Chromium is the open-source project at the heart of Chrome and many other web browsers, available not just as source code but also as a standalone browser itself. While everything in Chromium is also found in its direct descendant Chrome, you should keep in mind that they are two different, but related web browsers.

As Chromium is open-source, many have contributed to its development and various web browsers have been built upon the Chromium’s pillars.  On the other hand, Chrome is nowadays one of the giants in the web browsers landscape, based on Chromium, but with additional features and options contributed by Google’s development teams, such as the DRM support or the automatic update system. Moreover, the data gathering mechanism is implemented by Google’s team in Chrome, while Chromium lacks such reporting capabilities.

Another difference resides in their stability. The browser built on the Chromium’s source code is also called Chromium and is updated almost on a daily basis, which is a proof of a much less stable package compared to Chrome. While Chromium is rough down to its core, with much more bugs, Chrome provides users with one of the most reliable web browsers out there, delivering a solid feature set and security-related options.

When running and using Chromium, you will recognize a lot of Chrome in it, which is only normal. You might end up thinking that there are not so many differences in functionality. And you might be right.

The interface of Chromium is practically identical to that of Chrome. It sports  the exact same options as its offspring, including the support for add-ons and themes. You get the integrated download and bookmark managers, developer tools, support for incognito instances and other similar features you might be familiar with. It’s safe to say that Chromium is a lighter Chrome that provides almost the same functionality as Google’s star product.

The few differences between Chromium and Chrome are, in fact, essential. The inherent instability of Chromium and the stripped-down feature set are practically the reason behind the huge gap between the usage rates of the two browsers. Nevertheless, Chromium remains a fast-browsing solution, an “ancestor” that shares digital DNA with Chrome and various other less popular web browsers.


##### Maxton
The market is constantly flooded with all kinds of browsers, some of them inspired by old ones, while others strive to bring innovation to the table.

Maxthon is one of the browsers that has managed to stand the test of time, considering it has been launched in 2002. It has undergone several transformations in the meantime, in an effort to keep track with all the technology changes and advancements, with the newest version being based on Chromium.

Since Maxthon runs on Chromium core, this means it is compatible with all extensions and apps designed for this engine, while retaining compatibility with the major previous iterations of Maxthon. In other words, you can easily install your favorite Chrome extensions and enjoy their functionality while working in Maxthon as well.

You can easily import other browsers' local data to continue work where you left off (compatible browsers are Maxthon 5, Chrome, Edge, IE and Firefox). Alternatively, you can take advantage of the cloud sync feature and login with the same account on several devices, so as to share data between these devices without any hassle.

In addition to the standard security provided by the Chromium engine, Maxthon brings some additional features to the mix, the most notable being blockchain support.

You can set up secure identities and assets to make sure your online privacy is always protected. Moreover, if you are a developer, you can create cryptographically sound apps using the Vbox and NBdomain interfaces, packed within Maxthon.

Maxthon will surely continue begins the go-to browser for thousands of users all over the world, mostly due to their commitment to providing a secure yet neatly-looking browser. It can be personalized within seconds even by novices whereas experts can go deeper and experiment with the blockchain support.

##### CoolNoVo
Formerly known as ChromePlus, CoolNovo is an enhanced version of the Chrome web browser that bundles a few very welcomed extra features, such as mouse gestures, super drag, and an improved download manager.

The simple installation procedure is followed by a starting guide, a sort of tutorial that walks you through the special abilities of CoolNovo. The explanations are accompanied by pictures, so you can easily identify the functions later on.

Truth be told, CoolNovo does sport a few outstanding features. For instance, you can switch to Internet Explorer mode when you access websites which do not support Chrome, restore closed tabs with the click of a button in the toolbar, and save your configuration data to the servers in the cloud in order to synchronize it with other computers.

CoolNovo comes with mouse gestures (e.g. scroll page up and down, open previous or next tab, navigate back and forward, reload current or all tabs, stop loading, new homepage tab), super drag (drag and open a page in foreground of background), download tools supported in the context menu, enhanced bookmarks, as well as the ability to double click or right click the tab area to close the page.

You can configure tabs, mouse gestures, the bookmarks bar, downloads, privacy data, IE tab settings, Adblock and the accelerator from the Options section of the application.

CoolNovo is extremely fast, and it uses a lesser amount of system resources than Chrome does. Switching to IE mode is very simple, and mouse gestures are practical, although you need some time to get used to them.

In conclusion, CoolNovo is an enhanced version of Chrome, one that makes browsing easier and more comfortable. By providing all of the aforementioned features, it’s safe to say that CoolNovo represents serious competition for Google’s browser.


#### SlimBrowser
It's been well over a decade since SlimBrowser was launched, and while it didn't shake up the browser industry at the time, it improved constantly over the years, becoming one of the many good web browsers out there.

Describing SlimBrowser in just a few words can prove a bit difficult - not because the browser doesn't have enough specific features, but rather because it boasts a lot of useful features. Be that as it may, SlimbBrowser is all about speed, security, versatility, and convenience.

The first thing you should know about this web browser is the fact that it uses the Gecko engine, the same engine used by Mozilla Firefox. Hence, if you've ever used Firefox (post-Quantum versions), you should feel right at home on SlimBrowser because the GUI is practically identical as well.

While this question is a legitimate one since, after all, Mozilla Firefox is one of the top-3 browsers out there, here are a few reasons why you might want to consider SlimbBrowser instead.

To start off with, this is a very fast web browser. While we won't go as far as to say it's astonishingly faster than other browsers, the difference in speed between it and most staple browsers is noticeable. This is partly thanks to its multi-thread architecture, and partly thanks to its built-in adblocker.

There are other goodies as well, and even though they might seem a bit "niche," it's good knowing that all of these features are built-in. These include a YouTube Video to MP4 and MP3 downloader, an ultra-fast, multi-threaded download manager (which also allows you to resume "broken" downloads), a Web Page and Text translation tool, and one-click Facebook integration.

The browser also has a tool that allows you to upload photos fast and even slightly edit them by adding frames and other effects (can even shrink photos to make them web-optimized), a page screenshot tool, as well as a built-in weather forecast tool. Needless to say, the browser benefits from all the convenience usually found in Firefox browsers in terms of customization. You can fully customize the toolbar, and even set up various mouse gestures to help you improve the way you work.

If that's still not enough, then you can install a few plug-ins and themes from the add-on library.

Even though its name might suggest it, the browser is all about improving your productivity thanks to its plethora of useful tools. One of the best things about SlimBrowser is that it manages to encompass all these tools within a familiar GUI and on top of a very good engine, without feeling bloated or overloaded.

#### Portable Firefox
Mozilla Firefox is among the major players when it comes to web browsers, providing a clean and organized workspace and excellent browsing speed. Released under an open-source license, it features customization tools and advanced options that enables you to greatly enhance your user experience.

Portable Firefox is a special edition of the popular web browser that can be used on the go, directly from a removable storage device. The advantages of a portable application are well known: no installation is required and there is no impact on the registry of the host system, as all the settings are stored in the browser’s folder. Other than that, there are no differences between the standalone and the portable editions when it comes to functionality or looks.

Portable Firefox is one of the top choices of many, and for good reason. Not just that it offers a rich feature set for free and lightning-fast loading speed, but it is geared toward security, leaving no room for privacy invasion.

It collects very little information about you as a user and, what’s more, it does not allow third-parties to collect data either. To be more specific, Portable Firefox automatically blocks third-party tracking cookies, social tracking and crypto mining attempts.

As you can see, most Internet trackers are blocked by default in Portable Firefox, which means you do not have to waste time configuring a solid privacy policy. There is a private browsing mode that logs no data at all.

Continuing with the security-related features, it is worth mentioning that Portable Firefox features breached website alerts and an integrated password manager.

Whether it is for work or leisure, using Portable Firefox can enhance your productivity. The browser features a bookmark manager, spell checking capabilities and a built-in screenshot tool. URL autosuggestion, fast search from the address bar, smart search suggestions or tab pinning are small features that, once you get used to, you might never want to let go. And, if you are a developer, you should know that Portable Firefox also accommodates a series of specialized tools for developers.

Thanks to the available customization options, you are free to create a work area that fits your requirements and needs. There is a plethora of themes available, as well as a library of extensions that can enhance the functionality of the browser.

Portable Firefox is a fast and reliable web browser, with a more than welcoming set of customization tools meant to make it tailor to the needs of any user, including developers. It is fast, secure and easy to operate, which are the three main pros in its favor.


##### Opera Portable
Opera is a renowned browser close to hitting 30 years of existence. The fact that it is still around, in an environment where Chrome and Firefox could have easily eclipsed it, is the result of unending improvements and tinkering with new ideas. One of those ideas could be Opera Portable, a flexible solution for users who wish to leave no browser traces in the system's registry, or for those looking to contain the app within a USB stick.

Unlike most portable tools, Opera Portable comes with a pseudo-installer, which simply unpacks the app in whatever location you have chosen. During this phase, you can decide what type un extraction to go with. If you are sharing your PC, you can choose to hide the browser from other users. In case you must handle multiple machines, you might want to go with a USB standalone installation, and explore the web from the safety of your thumb stick.

Just like its standard version, Opera Portable comes with a handy, highly-customizable sidebar. This sidebar provides quick access to your messenger apps like Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, etc. It contains special features such as a multimedia player, My Flow, and even a Crypto Wallet.

At the same time, the sidebar lets you manage your bookmarks, history, and downloads. Create a news list with the sources and sites you are following, and the Personal News pane will deliver handpicked articles on a daily basis. Lastly, if you don't like the sidebar, you can simply hide it.

Portable Opera comes with a free-of-charge VPN service. Still, a browser VPN has its limitations. However, if you are more interested in changing IPs in order to access location-based content, this VPN is more than enough.

As far as ads are concerned, Opera has a simple answer to that as well - an integrated Ad-blocker with a simple on/off switch. Just like the VPN, the ad-blocker has its inconsistencies from time to time, when it lets some ads pass through. A simple refresh of the page should solve it.

Opera Portable is a user-friendly browser, but also a powerhouse in the right hands. This portable version is great for anyone interested in browsing within a more contained environment, like a local directory or a USB thumb stick.

##### Pale Moon
A whole lot has changed in the last 10 years in regards to how the Internet affects and helps our lives, but one thing that’s remained largely the same is that we still use web browsers as our staple picks when it comes to getting work done online.

Nowadays, the browser industry is heavily dominated by a few popular names, but the most interesting aspect of it is the sheer number of good alternatives currently present on the market. Released in late 2009, Pale Moon has managed to carve a good reputation among the best browsers of the industry and has since remained one of the best options for a specific niche of users out there.

Sporting the motto “Your browser, Your way,” Pale Moon is all about customizability, stability, and speed. Most of you might know by now that the project is actually a fork of Mozilla’s Firefox with various hand-picked features and optimizations.

Here’s a quick overview: Pale Moon always runs in single-process mode, whereas the modern versions of Firefox all run on a multi-process mode. It replaced the Gecko browser engine with  Goanna-forked one, defaults to a welcoming and very customizable start page (start.me collaboration), it uses DuckDuckGo as its default engine (instead of Google or !Yahoo), and it uses the IP-API service and not Google’s geolocation engines.

Even though it uses the somewhat old-school user interface of Firefox browsers of old (version 4-28), the browser is a modern and actively-maintained product. This means that it is optimized for modern processors, it’s secure since up-to-date security features are constantly added to the project’s core, and extensive and growing support for some of the latest and most relevant web standards.

There are various other divergences from the Firefox version, and two of them represent two of the main reasons people love Pale Moon. The first and foremost is the fact that the browser uses the pre-Australis Firefox user interface. Even though outdated in terms of looks (the interface is still preferred by many users for its numerous customization capabilities and somewhat more approachable nature.

The second feature that makes Pale Moon so popular is the fact that it still supports various old Firefox add-ons (most of which are no longer supported by the newer version of Firefox, and had to be built from the ground up to make them work). To be more precise, it offers support for XUL, XPCOM, and NPAPI plugins, the so-called “legacy” Firefox extensions.

Other noteworthy benefits include support for lightweight themes, as well as for full-themes offering users potentially limitless freedom when it comes to any element’s design, as well as support for a growing number of Pale Moon-exclusive extensions.

The short answer is – "it's difficult to tell." Despite its impressive popularity, Pale Moon was never intended to be a fierce competitor for the big names of the industry. Instead, it was created to offer the best possible user experience for users who loved the old Firefox.

Even if we were to disregard all the aforementioned features, Pale Moon would still be a good browser. Because the browser does not bundle some of the many irrelevant bits and bobs found in the old Firefox engine, it’s incredibly fast and very stable. Install it on a modern machine and you can definitely see a slight improvement in speed when compared to your modern browser, but the beauty of Pale Moon is that it also works on older machines with older versions of Windows.

It also boasts almost everything a modern browser offers. You can work with multiple tabs, pin your favorite ones, activate full-screen view, create, save, and manage bookmarks, change the default search engine, clear your recent history, manage downloads with ease, and import or export details such as options, bookmarks, passwords, and other such details from other browsers. All of that, plus the big benefit of being able to almost fully customize all aspects of the app’s GUI.

To conclude, Pale Moon never was and will also never be regarded as the best all-round browser out there. However, thanks to its unique approach towards offering a top-notch user experience focused on stability, customizability, and security, it will continue to be the favorite option for some particular people out there.

#### GreenBrowser
The Internet browser software category is ever-growing and usually the newest additions, just as some of the older apps, draw inspiration from successful engines that proved their value over time. Among them, GreenBrowser, an Internet Explorer-based solution tries to make a claim to glory.

The interface bears the marks of the well-known IE, but this particular browser brings a lot of improvements under the hood, such as a form filler, mouse gestures and, of course, tabbed browsing.

What's more, you can save several pages as a group, activate a boss key for quickly hiding the browser, create Speed Dials for opening your favorite websites with just one click, as well as install plugins.

While testing it, we found that one if not the most useful feature bundled into GreenBrowser is the fill manager. It automatically completes forms for you, so that you don't have to spend time writing down names, addresses or logins every time a webpage prompts you to.

If you like to keep many tabs open, you will notice the application can become a bit heavy on system resources, especially if the loaded pages contain a lot of Flash elements. However, you should note that this problem is not particular to this app as it occurs with most browsers out there.

The 'Options' menu is pretty rich and holds settings for all the features offered through GreenBrowser, including tabs, mouse gestures, popup filters and shortcut keys. You can customize almost every single function and personalize the way in which the software works on your system.

Overall, GreenBrowser can be a viable alternative if you are eager to try something else aside from the big brands in the business. It packs some quite handy functions and, given its ease of use, the program may appeal to a variety of users.

#### Portable Avant Browser Ultimate
This tool is the portable version of the well-known Avant Browser, one of the strongest software when it comes to web browsers.

Since it is a portable product, Avant Browser does not need to be installed, so the Windows registry files will not change. It also means that you can place Portable Avant Browser on a USB flash drive and use it from any computer.

The user interface of this app is pretty minimalistic, which is great news for most power users who do not want to deal with cluttered features.

From the File menu, you can manage multiple accounts, save web pages as HTML, text or image, import and export bookmarks, or start a new private browsing session.

Toolbars can be enabled or disabled, according to your preferences - standard buttons, address bar, search bar, bookmarks bar, add-on buttons, tabs bar, management bar, but you can also customize buttons (e.g. large or small icons, enable or disable text under buttons).

You can switch to full screen or full desktop mode, but also split the view. You can also save forms, organize and password-protect AutoFill.

The Options menu allows you to completely customize Avant Browser's features - block unwanted pop-up pages, disable pictures, videos, sounds or scripts, configure the "new tab" command, mouse buttons and mouse gestures, enable Auto-Complete for the address tab, enable tray icon, specify email client for reading emails, change proxy server options, clear records, add URL aliases, and many more.

When it comes to speed, Avant Browser seems to perform faster than other web browsers, and it uses a smaller amount of CPU and memory resources.

We have not encountered any problems during our tests, so we definitely recommend you try Portable Avant Browser.


##### Comodo Dragon
Drawing its source code from Chromium, Comodo Dragon is a fast web browser that mostly puts emphasis security while surfing the Internet. It contains several handy extensions and shares most of its features with Chrome.

Installing the app shouldn't be a difficult task. It can be copied as a portable tool in order to run it on any machine directly from a pen drive.

Comodo offers to install Adobe Flash Player if it doesn't already exist on the PC, which it actually needs in order to display all content correctly. It also recommends the use of COMODO Secure DNS servers in order to improve security.

The GUI is the same as in Chrome, and some of their features are shared as well. It is possible to browse multiple pages in multiple tabs, import bookmarks from other browsers and manage them easily, as well as log in with a Google account to synchronize data across all devices, to name but a few.

You can specify a master password to access all the other passwords saved within Comodo on websites, as well as enter sandbox mode to enhance security by navigating the web in a virtual environment cut off from the rest of the computer (requires Comodo Internet Security).

The web browser is shipped with several extensions installed. For example, you can analyze websites to spot malicious activity with the help of Web Inspector, as well as easily share text, links and images on social networks or look them up online via the Drag&Drop Service.

We have not come across stability issues in our evaluation. It had minimal impact on computer performance and quickly loaded web pages. No error dialogs popped up, and the tool did not hang or crash. To sum it up, Chrome users interested in extra security features may test Comodo Dragon for themselves to find out whether it meets their requirements or not.

#### SeaMonkey
Browsers have gotten more advanced over the years, and they're constantly evolving each day. The competition is stiff, which is all the better for everyone, as the solutions to choose from are numerous.

It's tough to stay afloat with such tight competition, but sometimes you see browsers attempting to extend their functionality beyond what one would expect, and SeaMonkey is one such example. A robust browser client with advanced e-mail and IRC capabilities, built upon Firefox's source code, with an old-school touch to its design.

The app maintains a very old-school-looking design, where navigation buttons are big and colorful, faintly reminding one of the Windows 98-XP eras. This design may be off-putting to some, but you should know that, at its core, it's still a modern browser: the default search engine is the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo, and the general browsing experience is very smooth.

If the design appeals to you, then you'll appreciate the themes on offer for this browser. Whether you want an Aero-based theme, a deeper Windows 98 look, or something even more retro, it's clear that the program (and its users) embrace such designs.

What sets this browser apart are the features nested in the Window menu. Essentially, users can access a full-fledged e-mail client right from this program. Aside from that, the app also comes equipped with an address book and IRC, such features bringing a tremendous amount of added value.

Browser clients are already complex, but you can check your mailbox, reply and send emails to anyone you want, and chat with your friends through ChatZilla, the integrated IRC client.

Considering that it's based on the Mozilla Firefox source code — which Thunderbird also happens to incorporate — it's not at all surprising that such features are present here. Everything is fully functional, which is a commendable thing when talking about such versatile software: the browser, e-mail, and IRC clients all worked without fault in our testing, and the experience was a pleasant one.

SeaMonkey is a behemoth of a program that manages to encompass lots of features that complement one another beautifully, which is why trying it will be worth your while.


#### Portable Maxthon
It might come as a surprise to some, but Chrome, Firefox and Opera are not the only browsers out there. In fact, there are alternatives that bring to the table interesting features, although not many can match the bar set by the giants in this sector. One of them is Maxthon Portable, a web browser with a significant number of users worldwide, that relies on a robust engine and provides support for blockchain technology. 

First, let us note that this edition of Maxthon does not require installation, meaning you can use it on the go without leaving traces on the host system. The user profile data is stored in the same folder as the application itself, which allows you to launch the browser directly from a removable drive. Evidently, the registry of the host computer is not affected, as it happens with any portable application. 

When launching Maxthon Portable for the first time, you are greeted by the Welcome tab and the Maxthon Now tab. The first allows quick browser setup: you can import local data from other browsers, sign up or sign in to Maxthon’s cloud storage, try out the blockchain ID manager or launch blockchain apps. Moreover, there are options to personalize Maxthon’s appearance and configure addons to extend its functionality. 

And speaking on addons, it must be noted that no extensions were supported in the previous versions of Maxthon, as the browser was based on a dual-core design, using both WebKit and Trident rendering engines. In the attempt to rise up to the industry standards in terms of performance, features and stability, as well as enhance the user’s experience, Maxthon’s kernel is based on Chromium, starting with the first releases of version 6. 

Moving past the ad-filled “Maxthon Now” tab that greets you upon the first launch, Mathon Portable behaves similarly to any other Chromium-based browser. You will recognize the familiar design of the tabs and the basic feature set that all modern browsers share. 

There is a built-in download manager, a browsing history tracker and the Incognito mode that allows you to open pages in non-trackable mode. Managing the default search engine and the start pages, tabs, downloads and other such options is easily done in the “Settings” area. Mathon Portable features extended customization possibilities and comes with support for mouse gestures.

As for security, Mathon Portable is designed with privacy in mind. For instance, you can configure it to avoid user tracking, manage certificates and decide upon the information that visited websites can access. 

As mentioned above, Mathon Portable supports blockchain apps and ID management, using the NBdomain protocol. It is possible to create blockchain identities and assets to ensure enhanced browsing privacy. 

It is worth noting that Portable Maxthon brings to the table features that it prides itself with since older versions, such as the Maxnote or the Passkeeper app. Ass their name suggests, Maxnote is designed to help you create and organize notes, which is quite helpful during research sessions. The name of Passkeeper is also quite suggestive. This utility stores autosaved passwwords, accounts and private notes in a secure vault.  Other features worth mentioning are the nightmode in Portable Maxthon, designed to reduce eye strain during nighttime, the built-in snapshot taker and the compatibility with all the extensions in the Chrome web store.

While prior versions of Portable Maxthon were questionable in terms of performance and stability in comparison with the major players, the latest versions of the browser offer security, speed and versatility. With the new enhancements, Portable Maxthon became a better alternative to the popular names, while preserving some of the functions that its loyal users enjoyed from the first editions onwards.
